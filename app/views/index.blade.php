<p>Developer's Tool Kit provides the developer with four tools to aid website/application development: A lorem ipsum generator, a random user generator, a base 32 encoder and a base 32 decoder. Only four tools were included due to time constrain, but the goal will be to keep adding tools in order to make website/application development tasks easier.<p>
<h2 class="content-subhead">Create Lorem </h2>
<p>
    On the Lorem application the user can create filler text in order to demonstrate graphic elements of a website or application. Lorem Ipsum text is a filler used to show how the actual text will be displayed once a web application is completed.
